# Sandbox

Most of the C# code is written for WinForms (luckily, I get to play with cutting edge frameworks at work, so I don't feel left out by using an old framework here). It's great for jumping into a small project right away, making a simple GUI, and focusing on the algorithms/problem solving - not the setup of a more advanced framework.

The old python scripts folder contains stuff from my early days of programming that I don't want to lose for nostalgia purposes.

Some of the python files need Pillow installed
